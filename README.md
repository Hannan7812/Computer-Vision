# Hand Gesture-controlled Backlight Adjuster

This Python script uses the Mediapipe library to detect hand landmarks in a video feed from the camera. It calculates the distance between two specified landmarks on the hand and adjusts the brightness of the backlight accordingly.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Mediapipe (`mediapipe`)

Make sure to install these dependencies before running the script:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
